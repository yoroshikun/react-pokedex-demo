# React NextJs Pokedex Demo

This is a recreation of a previous coding challenge task, which you can find [here](https://github.com/yoroshikun/foxp2React/), with a focus on implementing optimizations and experience gained up to now

## Goals

[x] - Refined developer experience (typescript)

[x] - Reduction of dependencies

[x] - Optimization of Render Cycles (No useless calls)

## Running Example

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
